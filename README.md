# COSC 5340: Programming Languages

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Welcome to my COSC 5340 Programming Languages repository!

This repository contains coding homework and assignments that I completed during my master's program at The University of Texas at Tyler. These samples showcase my ability to program and code efficiently across various programming languages and paradigms.

In this collection, you'll find:

- **Assignments** that demonstrate my understanding of different programming languages.
- **Examples** of coding practices that reflect my problem-solving skills and technical proficiency.
- **Documentation** for each assignment explaining the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

I aim to use this repository not only as a portfolio to validate my skill set but also as a resource for future reference. I hope these coding samples serve as a testament to my journey in mastering programming languages.

Feel free to explore the projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!

Happy coding!
